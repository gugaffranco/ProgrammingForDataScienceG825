# ProgrammingForDataScience - G8 - 2025

## Project Goal
In the wake of increasing mobility across Europe, fueled by remote work, international education, and shifting social and economic priorities, there has been growing demand for tools that help citizens make better-informed decisions about where to live. Recognizing this, the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) has launched a new initiative focused on improving access to comparative information about living conditions, opportunities, and quality of life across member states.

To support this initiative, a data science task force was assembled, comprised of researchers and developers across Europe. You were selected as part of this effort to design a tool that translates complex country-level data into clear, actionable insights for everyday people: students seeking affordable education, professionals looking for better work-life balance, retirees interested in safety and healthcare, and more.

This project, "Where Should I Live", aims to simplify this decision-making process by analyzing key characteristics of European countries, such as cost of living, safety, and employment. Through exploratory analysis, visualizations, and interpretable insights, your goal is to build a framework that empowers users to evaluate which countries align best with their personal values and life goals.
